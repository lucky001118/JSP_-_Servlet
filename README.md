# JSP and Servlet Learning Repository  

This repository contains code and projects developed during my learning journey with **Java Server Pages (JSP)** and **Servlets**. These files demonstrate fundamental and advanced concepts of web development using Java-based technologies.  

## Contents  
- **Core JSP and Servlet Concepts:**  
  Examples of working with HTTP requests, responses, session management, cookies, and more.  

- **Mini-Projects and Demos:**  
  - Basic Login and Registration System  
  - CRUD Operations with MySQL  
  - Blog Management System  
  - User Authentication and Profile Customization  

- **Backend Technologies Used:**  
  - **Java** (JSP, Servlets)  
  - **MySQL** for database management  

- **Frontend Technologies Used:**  
  - **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**  
  - **Material CSS** for modern UI components  
  - **AJAX** for asynchronous operations  

## Features  
- Examples of MVC architecture in Java web applications.  
- Integration of backend logic with the frontend UI.  
- Best practices for form validation and data management.  

## Prerequisites  
To run the projects, you will need:  
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**  
- **Apache Tomcat Server** (or any compatible servlet container)  
- **MySQL Database**  
- A suitable IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA  

## How to Use  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/jsp-servlet-learning.git  
   ```  
2. Import the project into your IDE.  
3. Configure the database connection in the project files (usually in `dbconfig` or similar files).  
4. Deploy the application on your Apache Tomcat server.  
5. Access the application through your browser.
